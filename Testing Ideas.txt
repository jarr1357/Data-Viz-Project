Red: 
data 0
data same for past 7 days

data well outside of range

Yellow:
data same for 25% of past 7 days

suspected out of range data

else:
Green

Integral of a cetain timeframe
Example total flow over x hours

Derivative

Instattaneous rate of change
Examples watched for sensor spikes over time

Proportional
Current range vs setpoint
Eg current voltage over 0(setpoint)

Mean median mode

Average over time
Filters out sensor spikes

Reoccurring data patterns against time flow
Eg solar panels over 24 hour period

Detect sensor changes pole to pole
